2. Other options:
  1.
  We could keep a list and remember all the numbers that are used if we randomly receive a number that was used we can request the number again until we get all of the numbers.
  This is not smart as randomly we do not know of all of the potential options.
    
3. 
  Code:
  Time complexity for this option is O(n).
  Space Complexity is O(n)
  Other Options 1:
  Time complexity O(n^n) we might get the same number over and over and over
  Space Complexity O(n) we remember all the numbers we used.
